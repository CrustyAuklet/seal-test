## Bare Bones Seal example project

This project demonstrates a blinky project on a SAML21G18B using the Seal-device cmsis package. Since CMake is used many different IDEs will work with this project. To demonstrate this the necessary config files will be included for:
  * VSCode
  * Visual Studio with CMake Support
  * Clion
  * Qt Creator
  * Command Line (of course)
